# Hackerrank - Kotlin
This repo is my attempt on solving hackerrank's problem solving challenge using kotlin language, unit test included.  

### Why Do I Use Object?
Because you can use the function inside without having to instance the object itself, so it makes it easier for testing.

### Unit Test (w/ JUnit5 and [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth))
The unit test's test case I used is based on one of the sample input and output included on the problem itself, but all the problem I've included on this repo is only the one that have passed all test cases on Hackerrank's platform so it's all good.

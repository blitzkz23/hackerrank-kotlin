# Hackerrank - Kotlin
This repo is my attempt on solving hackerrank's problem solving challenge using kotlin language, unit test included.  Problem that I solved here are categorized based on hackerrank's problem subdomain which include warmup, implementation, strings, etc.

### Why Do I Use Object?
Object in kotlin have a static characteristic, so we can immediately use the function inside of the object without having to create an instance of the class itself.  This makes it easier for testing purpose.

### Unit Test (w/ JUnit5 and [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth))
The unit test's test case I used is based on one of the sample input and output included on the problem itself, but all the problem I've included on this repo is only the one that have passed all test cases on Hackerrank's platform so it's all good.  Also, I used [Stefanbirkner's library](https://github.com/stefanbirkner/system-lambda) to assert the value of printed function.
